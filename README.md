# Data Visualization in Python
## I. Why Visualization? 
Data visualization is one of the key components in exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the data analytics process. EDA allows data scientists to have a quick overview of the data and inform the directions for further inferential or predictive analysis (e.g., regression, model design). Data visualization is an impactful way to do EDA, for example, it is much easier to observe trends from a line graph as compared to reading a series of numbers. However, data visualizations have to be done thoughtfully. From the choice of the graphs to the visual design elements (e.g., colours, fonts), these are all important decisions that data scientists have to make meaningfully. 
## II. Data Visualization in Python
There are multiple graphing libraries in Python, the more popular ones include matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot (yes, the old friend from R), and plotly. While matplotlib is the simplest one to use, I found its default layout lack a little bit of lustre without putting in additional efforts. With my UX background, I understand how people are more drawn to visually pleasent graphs and they are more willing to spend time to read. Thus, my preferred libraries are seaborn and plotly express. In here, I chose to demonstrate a previous project from my graduate studies using Plotly Express. Plotly Express allows one to build visualizations with tooltips without much addititional configuration.
